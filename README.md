This project emulates what an attack would look like. 
Simulating before the attack -> "grading" a password using entropy. Also, hashing algorithm performed on password -> simulate an attack on a hash comparing the hash value to the hashe enumerated password attempts rather than the raw password.

Furthermore, a seperate attack.py module that simulates a dictionary attack enumerating passwords mirroring with less detail like tools like dirbuster(web directories/url) and [Hydra](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/)

 This project consists of files: 
 "Attack.py", "Entropy.py", "Hashing.py" and a txt file - common_passwords.txt 

Common_passwords.txt accredited from [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master) - Compiled by DanielMiessler
